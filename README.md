# futurer-mari0
future mari0 is a work in progress port of [future mari0](https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/future-mari0), which itself is a port of the [mari0 1.6](http://stabyourself.net/mari0/) original code, to the löve 11.0 API. It aims to be as little intrusive as possible while guaranteeing total compatibility so löve distribution bound platforms can play the game.

This port inherits the problems specific to future mari0 as well as those specific to the original mari0 code.

Mari0 is a game by [Stabyourself](http://stabyourself.net/) under the [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) license.

## Packaging instructions

1. Go to the game/ folder.
2. Make a zip archive containing all of its files.
3. Make sure main.lua is at the top level of your zip.
4. Double-check just to make sure.
5. Change the extension of your zip to .love. So if it was mari0.zip before it becomes mari0.love.

If you did all the steps correctly, your game is ready to run, provided you have a 0.11.0 löve runtime. Get yours at [löve's official website](https://love2d.org).
